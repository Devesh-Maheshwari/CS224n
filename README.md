## My Solution of Assignments of CCS224n
This is my solution of three assignments of CS224n.
[CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) is
an interesting class, which teaches you to 
learn Natural language processing. This class provides some insights of cutting-edge research in deep learning applied to NLP. It covers word vector representations, window-based neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long-short-term-memory models, recursive neural networks, convolutional neural networks as well as some recent models involving a memory component.

**Note:** If you consult my code that you may want to incorporate into your strategy or algorithm, 
so long as you clearly cite your sources in your code and your writeup.
